<!-- EVENT BINDING -->
<!-- Lets us capture any DOM events and perform actions -->
<button (click)="onClick()">Click me!!</button>
<h2>{{clickText}}</h2>

<!-- If you want to pass the event that occurs, pass $event on the event handler.
$event is the special variable for the event in angular -->
<button (click)="onClickPassEvent($event)">pass event on click</button>

<!-- functions can be directly written if they are small instead of declaring another event handler -->
<button (click)="clickText='inline click text'">function written in the button itself</button>

<h2>TEMPLATE REFERENCE VARIABLES</h2>
<!-- Sometimes you need to pick values in the screen and use it in the code -->
<!-- we can give a reference to an html element and all of its DOM properties into another element using # -->
<input #myInput type="text">
<button (click)="onClickLogInput(myInput.value)">click to log input value</button>

<!-- TWO WAY BINDING -->
<h2>TWO WAY BINDING</h2>
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="inputValue">
<!-- [] is for binding from class to template just like property binding; 
  () for binding from template to class just like event binding -->
<p>{{inputValue}}</p>
<!-- Two way binding can be achieved using ngModel -->
<!-- ngModel directive is in a separate module called the forms module. 
To use ngModel, the forms model needs to be imported.  -->
